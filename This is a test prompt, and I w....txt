This is a test prompt, and I will upload your answer to my GitHub to get started with logging my usage of AI tools. Can you tell me a joke? And maybe send a greeting to my instructor who might read this when looking over my weekly exercises.

Sure! Hereâ€™s a joke for you:

Why don't scientists trust atoms?

Because they make up everything!

And a friendly greeting for your instructor: 

Hello! I hope this week has been filled with learning and growth. Thank you for guiding us through this journey! 

Good luck with your GitHub documentation!
